# Porfolio Website

I built my portfolio over a couple weeks adding more parts over time. I used Vite as the base. I used React and Typescript as I wanted to use this opportunity to improve my typescript skills as well as Tailwind CSS. I really enjoyed how quick I was at styling using the documentation to find what I needed. For animations I used framer motion. I spent a lot of hours watching YouTube videos and watching examples while referring to the documentation.
